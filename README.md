 #Project Overview ðŸ“±
This project is a basic activity inspired by Instagram, where I worked with JSON data, implemented it using Node.js, EJS, and JavaScript. The primary focus was to understand how to send requests to the server and return appropriate responses, ensuring smooth communication between the client and the server.

#Key Features âœ¨
Dynamic Data Rendering: Utilized EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to render JSON data within HTML views.
Server-Side Logic: Handled HTTP requests and responses efficiently using Node.js.
JSON Data Handling: Implemented structured data in JSON format and displayed it dynamically.
Request-Response Flow: Learned how to manage requests and responses, which is essential in backend development.
What I Learned ðŸ’¡
How to create and manage routes using Node.js.
How to send requests to the server and respond with suitable data based on the clientâ€™s needs.
How to implement server-side rendering using EJS for dynamic and real-time content display.
Understanding the integration of JSON data with EJS templates and JavaScript.
